Subject: [PATCH] fix: remove non-existent http_user_agent_ios.mm from iOS CMake

The http_user_agent_ios.mm file is referenced in CMakeLists.txt but
doesn't exist in the repository. This causes CMake configuration to
fail for iOS builds. Remove the reference since the functionality
appears to be unused.

Also add http_session_manager.mm which is needed for iOS networking.
