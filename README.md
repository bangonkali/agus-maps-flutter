## What is Agus Maps?

Agus Maps Flutter is a **native Flutter plugin** that embeds the powerful [CoMaps](https://github.com/comaps/comaps) (fork of Organic Maps) rendering engine directly into your Flutter app. Unlike tile-based solutions, it renders **vector maps** with zero-copy GPU acceleration, delivering smooth 60fps performance even on low-end devices.

### Why Another Map Plugin?

Most Flutter map solutions either:
- Render tiles in Dart (slow, GC pressure, jank on older devices)
- Use PlatformView embedding (performance overhead, gesture conflicts, "airspace" issues)

**Agus Maps takes a different approach:** The C++ rendering engine draws directly to a GPU texture that Flutter composites natively—no copies, no bridges, no compromises.

---

## Features

- 🚀 **Zero-Copy Rendering** — Map data flows directly from disk to GPU via memory-mapping
- 📴 **Fully Offline** — No internet required; uses compact MWM map files from OpenStreetMap
- 🎯 **Native Performance** — The battle-tested Drape engine from Organic Maps
- 🖐️ **Gesture Support** — Pan, pinch-to-zoom, rotation (multitouch)
- 📐 **Responsive** — Automatically handles resize and device pixel ratio
- 🔌 **Simple API** — Drop-in `AgusMap` widget with `AgusMapController`
- 📥 **Map Download Manager** — Browse and download maps from mirror servers with progress tracking
- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search** — Search for regions with intelligent fuzzy matching
- 💾 **Caching** — Downloaded region data cached locally for instant subsequent loads
- 📊 **Disk Space Management** — Real-time disk space monitoring with safety checks

---

## Quick Start

### Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  agus_maps_flutter: ^0.1.0
```

### Basic Usage

```dart
import 'package:agus_maps_flutter/agus_maps_flutter.dart';

// Initialize the engine (call once at app startup)
await agus_maps_flutter.initWithPaths(dataPath, dataPath);
agus_maps_flutter.loadMap(mapFilePath);

// Add the map widget
AgusMap(
  initialLat: 36.1408,
  initialLon: -5.3536,
  initialZoom: 14,
  onMapReady: () => print('Map is ready!'),
)
```

### Programmatic Control

```dart
final controller = AgusMapController();

AgusMap(
  controller: controller,
  // ...
)

// Move the map
controller.moveToLocation(40.4168, -3.7038, 12);
```

See the [example app](example/) for a complete working demo.

<h2 id="comparison">Comparison with Other Solutions</h2>

| Feature | Agus Maps | flutter_map | google_maps_flutter | mapbox_gl |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Rendering** | Native GPU (zero-copy) | Dart/Skia | PlatformView | PlatformView |
| **Offline Support** | ✅ Full | ✅ With tiles | ❌ Limited | ✅ With SDK |
| **Performance** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Memory Usage** | Very Low | High (GC) | Medium | Medium |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | BSD | Proprietary | Proprietary |
| **Pricing** | Free | Free | Usage-based | Usage-based |
| **Data Source** | OpenStreetMap | Any tiles | Google | Mapbox |
| **Widget Integration** | ✅ Native | ✅ Native | ⚠️ PlatformView | ⚠️ PlatformView |

### Pros ✅

- **Truly offline** — No API keys, no usage limits, no internet dependency
- **Best-in-class performance** — The same engine that powers Organic Maps (20M+ users)
- **Privacy-first** — No telemetry, no tracking, data stays on device
- **Compact map files** — Entire countries in tens of MB (Germany ~800MB, Gibraltar ~1MB)
- **Free forever** — Open source, Apache 2.0 license
- **Flutter-native composition** — No PlatformView overhead, works perfectly with overlays

### Cons ⚠️

- **Limited styling** — Uses Organic Maps' cartographic style (not customizable yet)
- **No real-time traffic** — Offline-first design means no live data
- **Android-only (currently)** — iOS, desktop platforms are planned but not yet implemented
- **MWM format required** — Must use pre-generated map files (not arbitrary tile servers)
- **Early stage** — Search and routing APIs not yet exposed

## Why It's Efficient

Agus Maps achieves excellent performance on older devices (tested on Samsung Galaxy S10) through architectural choices that minimize resource usage:

| Aspect | How We Achieve It | Learn More |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **Memory** | Memory-mapped files (mmap) — only viewed tiles loaded into RAM | [Details](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#memory-efficiency) |
| **Battery** | Event-driven rendering — CPU/GPU sleep when map is idle | [Details](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#battery-efficiency) |
| **CPU** | Multi-threaded — heavy work on background threads, UI never blocked | [Details](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#processor-efficiency) |
| **Startup** | One-time asset extraction, cached on subsequent launches | [Details](docs/IMPLEMENTATION-ANDROID.md) |

### Technical Deep Dives

For those who want to understand *why* Agus Maps is efficient:

- **[How Memory Mapping Works](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#memory-efficiency)** — Why we use 10x less RAM than tile-based solutions
- **[Battery Efficiency](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#battery-efficiency)** — Event-driven rendering that sleeps when idle
- **[Multi-threaded Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#processor-efficiency)** — How we keep the UI thread responsive
- **[Old Phone Compatibility](docs/ARCHITECTURE-ANDROID.md#why-this-works-on-older-phones)** — Tested on Samsung Galaxy S10 and similar devices

### Known Issues & Optimization Opportunities

## Map Data

Agus Maps uses MWM files from OpenStreetMap. You can download maps from:
- [Organic Maps Downloads](https://organicmaps.app/downloads/)
- [CoMaps Mirror](https://omaps.webfreak.org/)
- **In-app**: Use the built-in Downloads tab to browse and download regions

The example app bundles a small Gibraltar map for testing.
