## Building and Bundling Native Code

The `pubspec.yaml` specifies FFI plugins as follows:

```yaml
plugin:
  platforms:
    android:
      ffiPlugin: true
      package: app.agus.maps.agus_maps_flutter
      pluginClass: AgusMapsFlutterPlugin
```

This configuration invokes the native build for the various target platforms and bundles the binaries in Flutter applications.

### Platform-Specific Build Systems

| Platform | Build System | Config File |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Android | Gradle + NDK | `android/build.gradle` |
| iOS | Xcode + CocoaPods | `ios/agus_maps_flutter.podspec` |
| macOS | Xcode + CocoaPods | `macos/agus_maps_flutter.podspec` |
| Linux | CMake | `linux/CMakeLists.txt` |
| Windows | CMake | `windows/CMakeLists.txt` |

## FFI Bindings

FFI bindings are auto-generated from `src/agus_maps_flutter.h` using `package:ffigen`.

**Regenerate bindings after modifying the header:**

```bash
dart run ffigen --config ffigen.yaml
```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.x (stable channel)
- Android SDK with NDK r25c+
- CMake 3.18+
- Git

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/agus-app/agus_maps_flutter.git
cd agus_maps_flutter

# Fetch and patch CoMaps engine
./scripts/bootstrap_android.sh

# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build and run example
cd example
flutter run
```

### Rebuilding After Changes

```bash
# If you modified src/agus_maps_flutter.h
dart run ffigen --config ffigen.yaml

# Clean rebuild
cd example
flutter clean
flutter run
```

## CoMaps Patches

The `thirdparty/comaps` directory contains a patched checkout of CoMaps. Patches are maintained in `patches/comaps/` and applied via:

```bash
./scripts/apply_comaps_patches.sh
```

| Patch | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `0001-fix-cmake.patch` | CMake fixes for cross-compilation |
| `0002-platform-directory-resources.patch` | Directory-based resource loading |
| `0003-transliteration-directory-resources.patch` | ICU data file loading |
| `0004-fix-android-gl-function-pointers.patch` | GL function pointer resolution |

## Commit Guidelines

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks
- `refactor:` Code refactoring

Example:
```
feat(android): implement touch event forwarding

- Add comaps_touch() FFI function
- Support multitouch gestures
- Convert logical to physical coordinates
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run example app with logging
cd example
flutter run

# Monitor native logs (Android)
adb logcat | grep -E "(CoMaps|AGUS|drape)"
```
